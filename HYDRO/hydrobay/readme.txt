--------------------------

The Hydroponics Bay is not a finished product. Updates, add-ons and enhancements will be
released over the upcoming months, probably making it a more pleasant place for norns. At
the moment it resembles the Grendel Jungle more than anything else. The updates will be
released first from Bionorn's site and then from mine.

--------------------------

The HB is an area where the terrariums meet. There is life from all the other areas sharing
space in it. We have no idea if and how they will get on with each other, so watch and see. I
am currently unsure of how stable the ecosystem is, so any feedback from people will be much
appreciated. Once we have played with this room some more there will be patches out fixing any
problems.

I'm not going to say any more about it now. The door into it is on the Bridge. Go in, play
around, tell us what you think, and most importantly, have fun.
