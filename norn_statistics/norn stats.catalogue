"Norn Statistics" 
"This agent adds a panel to the left of the screen that displays various information about your creatures, including their age, life stage, generation, and if they have been through the warp.\n\nThe information is updated about every 15 seconds.\n\nIt also checks for possible immortal and fast-aging creatures by checking 3 indicators:\n\n\n\n1. Creatures older than 9 hours may be immortal.\n\n2. Creatures with 2 or more toxins in their body over 95 may be immortal.\n\n3. Creatures that reached adult stage before a certain age are probably fast-agers.\n\nIf any of these checks are matched then a ''boing'' sound will be heard and 1 or more letters will appear in square brackets along with the rest of the information for that creature:\n\nO = Old\nT = Toxins (not for Grendels)\nA = Aging\n\nThis checking can be turned on or off with the O/T/A button.\n\nThe top four buttons are used to toggle on or off the display of the various species and the two arrow buttons are used to scroll the window if there is more than one page of text.\n\nThe text at the bottom of the panel show the number of male, number of female and highest generation of each species."
