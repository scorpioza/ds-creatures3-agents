"Food Fountain"
"A magical fountain that will constantly provide your Creatures with food, fruit and seeds. To do this though it must be turned on *by the hand* (Norns, Ettins and Grendels can push the vendor, but this won't turn the fountain on or off). You can tell if the fountain is on by the button - red for off, green for on. This agent was originally made by Jessica at jessney@onthenet.com.au and was updated to work in DS by me. Any problems with the food fountain should be directed towards Jennifer at TwilightCat@hotmail.com "
