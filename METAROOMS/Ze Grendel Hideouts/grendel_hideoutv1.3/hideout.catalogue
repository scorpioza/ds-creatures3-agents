"Sneit"
"These critters are a true menace! They may look pretty thanks to their colours, but they will do just about anything to take a sip of your creatures blood, or even your own!. Once they have a victim, they’ll stick their long snout right through the skin, and suck the blood right out. And believe me, it it’s really painful!"

"Yummy Berry"
"So called because they do not only taste delicious, but has a thin peel, soft flesh and the seeds are tiny and eatable. This makes these berries especially great food for young and old creatures, who may not have any teeth to chew with!\n\nGrendels seem to have a particular taste for these berries, because the fruits seeds contain a lot of starch."

"Red Cap Mushroom"
"A close relative of the lethal Death cap mushroom, however, this species is completely harmless.\n\nOnce in a while, these fungi release cuddly lumps of accumulated spores. These collections contain millions of spores, but are still so light that they can take to the air with the slightest gust of wind. These lumps will also make a nutritious (but not very tasty) snack for any creature."
