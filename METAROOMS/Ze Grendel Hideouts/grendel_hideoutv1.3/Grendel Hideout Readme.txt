 The Grendel Hideout is a new metaroom for C3/DS
based on a combination of C2/C3 graphics. It's
perfect for your grendels, who'll adore the dark, 
moist environment!


To remove the room, simply inject the 'Grendel 
Hideout (Remove)' agent.

This has been one of the most graphically well-
done projects I have ever worked on, and
collaborating with Nirax has simply been a joy. 
Thankyou so much, Nirax, for your unceasing 
passion and dedication for the project and always
prodding me when I needed it!

Thanks also go to malkin, who helped resolve 
several Mac OS errors, to Don who helped resolve 
my compiling errors, to finally to Kate and her 
amazing ability to break almost ANYTHING!
